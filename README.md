# ROBOTIZE_JA 
Grand Project to "robotize" the island of Jamaica.

# GOAL
* In the aim of spreading Ai usage, I travel across the country in order to apply Ai for free (Tier A) for several institution types. 

* This is ofcourse limited only by the amount of time I have away from work, my reasonably good albeit growing knowledge/capacity in artificial intelligence, and lastly finances to begin. 
    * Artificial Intelligence Projects of mine/knowledge base:
        * Machine Learning Jamaica Institute (as seen in the subsidiary section at end of page)
        * [Heart Irregularity Detection using convolutional residual neural networks](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/EJECTION-FRACTION-IRREGULARITY-DETECTION-MODEL)
        * [Live ITS 2019 Neural Network Programming Tutorial](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Live-ITS-2019-Artificial-Neural-Network-Tutorial-Code)
        * [Smart Pothole Detector using fp16 convolutional neural networks](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Smart-Ai-Pothole-Detector------Powered-by-Tensorflow-TensorRT-on-Google-Colab-and-or-Jetson-Nano)
        * [Arrythmia detection in browser using convolutional neural networks](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Browser-Ai-Arrhythmia-Detection)
        
* Somewhat inexpensive laptops will be left on the premises of the institutions I aid on my account (for running trained ai models), while I will use my expensive desktop to train said Ai models.

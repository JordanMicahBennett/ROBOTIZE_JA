# ROBOTIZE_JA 
Grand Project to "robotize" the island of Jamaica.

# GOAL
* In the aim of spreading Ai usage, I travel across the country in order to apply Ai for free (Tier A) for several institution types. 

* This is ofcourse limited only by the amount of time I have away from work, my reasonably good albeit growing knowledge/capacity in artificial intelligence, and lastly finances to begin. 
* * test

* Somewhat inexpensive laptops will be left on the premises of the institutions I aid on my account (for running trained ai models), while I will use my expensive desktop to train said Ai models.

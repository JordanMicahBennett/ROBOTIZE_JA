# ROBOTIZE_JA 
Grand Project to "robotize" the island of Jamaica, [established on October 24, 2019](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/ROBOTIZE_JA/commits?after=9c96da75f01e1f6de4bc4a23690501df5bb0c502+104&author=JordanMicahBennett).

See how artificial intelligence/machine learning has demonstrably enhanced human life: [Youtube/Nvidia "I Am AI: GTC 2019 Kickoff"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWL1HNHDSq4)

# FAILURE TO ROBOTIZE JA?

See the following item, for a quick grasp of likely issues that may arise from failure to perform initiatives like RobotizeJa.
   * [Failure to "Robotize Jamaica".](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/ROBOTIZE_JA/blob/master/data/FAILURE-TO-ROBOTIZE-JAMAICA.md)

# QUICK START ON UNDERSTANDING WHAT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE/MACHINE LEARNING IS ABOUT
If need be, please see article 1/week 1 of my Gleaner column, for a reasonably concrete introduction to machine learning: "[Artificial Intelligence And The Economy | Utilising Artificial Intelligence Could Aid Economic Stimulation](http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20180604/artificial-intelligence-and-economy-utilising-artificial-intelligence-could)".





# GOAL
* In the aim of spreading Ai usage together with [Ai democratization](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/democratization-of-ai/), I travel across the country in order to apply Ai for free (Tier A) for several institution types. 

* This is of course limited only by the amount of time I have away from work, my reasonably good albeit growing knowledge/capacity in artificial intelligence, and lastly my personal finances to begin. 
    * Artificial Intelligence Projects of mine/knowledge base:
        * Machine Learning Jamaica Institute (as seen in the subsidiary section after this Goal section)
        * [Heart Irregularity Detection using convolutional residual neural networks](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/EJECTION-FRACTION-IRREGULARITY-DETECTION-MODEL)
        * [Smart Pothole Detector using fp16 convolutional neural networks](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Smart-Ai-Pothole-Detector------Powered-by-Tensorflow-TensorRT-on-Google-Colab-and-or-Jetson-Nano) ...
           * This project is featured by NVIDIA, on [their jetson projects page](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/community/jetson-projects). [NVIDIA](http://nvidia.com/) is a multi-billion dollar artificial intelligence involved company. [Their technology has been central to a large degree of humanity's progress so far.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWL1HNHDSq4)
        * [Arrhythmia detection in browser using convolutional neural networks](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Browser-Ai-Arrhythmia-Detection)
        * [Jetson nano neural computer programming](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/live_ai_object-detection-on-tiny-jetson-neural-nano-computer)
        * [Live ITS 2019 Neural Network Programming Tutorial](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Live-ITS-2019-Artificial-Neural-Network-Tutorial-Code)
        * [Artificial Neural Networks for kids - Amazon book](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Neural-Networks-Kids-intuitive-ebook/dp/B077FX57ZZ) ..which is [free on ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321162382_Artificial_Neural_Nets_For_Kids)
        * [Supersymmetric Artificial Neural Network - This is Machine Learning Theory](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Supersymmetric-artificial-neural-network)
        * [Fundamental neural network programming practice](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/NEURAL_NETWORK_PRACTICE) 
        
* Somewhat inexpensive laptops (bought using my personal finances) will be left on the premises of the institutions for their usage (for running "trained" ai models), while I will use my somewhat expensive desktop to "train" said Ai models where applicable.

# LIST OF AIDED INSTITUTIONS 

# 1. [AN ARITIFICAL INTELLIGENCE BASED CORONAVIRUS/COVID19 SOLUTION PREPARED FOR PUBLIC USE BY JORDAN BENNETT](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/SMART-CT-SCAN_BASED-COVID19_VIRUS_DETECTOR/blob/master/README.md)
* **Feb 9, 2020**: I discover similarities between Covid19 and known forms of pneumonia, after which I find a few CT-Images representing positive cases of Covid19 by Chinese authorities, where I decided to perform **_artificial intelligence based_** **CT Image Scan diagnostics**, by using the images as inputs to an artificial intelligence based pneumonia diagnosis method [originally published/made by John Chang in November 2019](https://github.com/JohnChangUK/Pneumonia-Kaggle). This reasoning is seen in my research/discovery process in the [Deep Learning Code section below](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/SMART-CT-SCAN_BASED-COVID19_VIRUS_DETECTOR#deep-learning-codetests--code-discussion--call-for-contribution).
* **Feb 19, 2020**: Scientists reveal a ~98% accuracy in **_human/radiology based_** **CT Scan image based diagnostics**, compared to the popular Dna polymerase chain reaction method by CDC: ["In a series of 51 patients with chest CT and RT-PCR assay performed within 3 days, the sensitivity of CT for COVID-19 infection was ~98% compared to RT-PCR sensitivity of ~71% (p<.001)."](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2020200432)
* **Feb 20, 2020**: Great news - Feb 20 news report published, that Chinese are using Ai to help identify the virus with reported ~99% accuracy, [via their own Ai based CT-scan method](http://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005216/scan-reading-ai-systems-are-helping-doctors-diagnose-covid-19). 
  * Unfortunately, unlike [this repository started by myself on Feb 9th](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/SMART-CT-SCAN_BASED-COVID19_VIRUS_DETECTOR/), no Chinese publication of ai based algorithms seems to have been made to the public to help facilitate global control of covid19/SarsCov2.

#COVID-19 AI DATA/CALL ON THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH 

I call on the [Ministry of Health](https://www.moh.gov.jm/) to utilize its administrative status to acquire more covid19 positive CT scan images, via China, for the purpose of further enhancing [this pneumonia based ai solution that I had prepared.](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/SMART-CT-SCAN_BASED-COVID19_VIRUS_DETECTOR/blob/master/README.md).
  * Alternatively, the Chinese artificial intelligence algorithm/solution together with the data could be attained using the same administrative method.



# UPDATES - RE: MY FACE TO FACE ADVICE TO UWI MONA AI LECTURER TO INTRODUCE MODERN AI TO COURSEWORK
* 2016: In a face to face talk, I had advised UWI Mona Ai lecturer to introduce neural networks/modern artificial intelligence as an independent course to the Computer Science degree.

* 2016 later: I also started [Machine learning Jamaica Institute](http://mlj-institute.appspot.com/), as an independent institution for machine learning/modern artificial intelligence.

* June 2018: [I write about my advice to UWI Mona to introduce neural networks/modern artificial intelligence as an independent course to the Computer Science degree, as well as Machine Learning Jamaica Institute initiative/platform.](http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20180604/artificial-intelligence-and-economy-utilising-artificial-intelligence-could)

* September 2018: 

    * [UWI Mona introduced Data science/modern artificial intelligence to the 1st degree Computer Science coursework!!!!!!](https://www.mona.uwi.edu/compsci/sites/default/files/compsci/uploads/department_of_computing_list_of_undergraduate_courses_2018-2019.pdf)

# UPDATES - JAMAICAN PRIME MINISTER, ANDREW HOLNESS PLANS TO BUILD STEM SCHOOLS IN RESPONSE TO GROWING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CHANGES IN SOCIETY.

* 2016: In a face to face talk, I had advised UWI Mona Ai lecturer to introduce neural networks/modern artificial intelligence as an independent course to the Computer Science degree.

* 2016 later: I also started machine learning Jamaica Institute, as an independent institution for artificial intelligence.

* June 2018: I write about my advice to UWI Mona to introduce neural networks/modern artificial intelligence as an independent course to the Computer Science degree, as well as "Machine Learning Jamaica Institute" initiative/platform.
	* Gleaner article: http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20180604/artificial-intelligence-and-economy-utilising-artificial-intelligence-could

	
* November 2019: 
	* Jamaica Prime minister Andrew Holness, [plans to build Stem focused schools in response to growing Artificial Intelligence impact](http://www.loopjamaica.com/content/gojchina-build-stem-schools-move-ja-21st-century-holness).

	
* However, I detect that STEM focused schools while excellent, will not be sufficient to adequately prepare for the incoming automation, where even cognitive tasks like radiology stem careers, are already being automated away now:
	* Breaking news: [We can now diagnose pneumonia from chest X-rays better than radiologists.](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/projects/chexnet/)
	* This is a part of the reason why I opted to start [Machine Learning Jamaica Institute](http://mlj-institute.appspot.com/) in 2016.




# UPDATES - MY ADVICE TO THE PRIME MINISTER OF JAMAICA TO ADD MINISTER OF "ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE" PORTFOLIO

I advise Jamaica Prime Minister, the Most Honourable Andrew Michael Holness, to help create a new political portfolio/role, namely "Minister of Artificial Intelligence" of Jamaica, in [my recent "letter of Artificial Intelligence" to him](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SnM2NvUlg6dmJKZo3i6lI9dMsOFvavbl).

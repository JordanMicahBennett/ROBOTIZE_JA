# ROBOTIZE_JA 
Grand Project to "robotize" the island of Jamaica, [established on October 24, 2019](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/ROBOTIZE_JA/commits?after=9c96da75f01e1f6de4bc4a23690501df5bb0c502+104&author=JordanMicahBennett).

See how artificial intelligence/machine learning has demonstrably enhanced human life: [Youtube/Nvidia "I Am AI: GTC 2019 Kickoff"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWL1HNHDSq4)

# FAILURE TO ROBOTIZE JA?

See the following item, for a quick grasp of likely issues that may arrise from failure to perform initiatives like RobotizeJa.
   * [Failure to "Robotize Jamaica".](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/ROBOTIZE_JA/blob/master/data/FAILURE-TO-ROBOTIZE-JAMAICA.md)

# QUICK START ON UNDERSTANDING WHAT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE/MACHINE LEARNING IS ABOUT
If need be, please see article 1/week 1 of my Gleaner column, for a reasonably concrete introduction to machine learning: "[Artificial Intelligence And The Economy | Utilising Artificial Intelligence Could Aid Economic Stimulation](http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20180604/artificial-intelligence-and-economy-utilising-artificial-intelligence-could)".




# GOAL
* In the aim of spreading Ai usage together with [Ai democratization](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/democratization-of-ai/), I travel across the country in order to apply Ai for free (Tier A) for several institution types. 

* This is of course limited only by the amount of time I have away from work, my reasonably good albeit growing knowledge/capacity in artificial intelligence, and lastly my personal finances to begin. 
    * Artificial Intelligence Projects of mine/knowledge base:
        * Machine Learning Jamaica Institute (as seen in the subsidiary section after this Goal section)
        * [Heart Irregularity Detection using convolutional residual neural networks](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/EJECTION-FRACTION-IRREGULARITY-DETECTION-MODEL)
        * [Smart Pothole Detector using fp16 convolutional neural networks](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Smart-Ai-Pothole-Detector------Powered-by-Tensorflow-TensorRT-on-Google-Colab-and-or-Jetson-Nano) ...
           * This project is featured by NVIDIA, on [their jetson projects page](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/community/jetson-projects). [NVIDIA](http://nvidia.com/) is a multi-billion dollar artificial intelligence involved company. [Their technology has been central to a large degree of humanity's progress so far.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWL1HNHDSq4)
        * [Arrhythmia detection in browser using convolutional neural networks](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Browser-Ai-Arrhythmia-Detection)
        * [Jetson nano neural computer programming](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/live_ai_object-detection-on-tiny-jetson-neural-nano-computer)
        * [Live ITS 2019 Neural Network Programming Tutorial](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Live-ITS-2019-Artificial-Neural-Network-Tutorial-Code)
        * [Artificial Neural Networks for kids - Amazon book](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Neural-Networks-Kids-intuitive-ebook/dp/B077FX57ZZ) ..which is [free on ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321162382_Artificial_Neural_Nets_For_Kids)
        * [Supersymmetric Artificial Neural Network - This is Machine Learning Theory](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Supersymmetric-artificial-neural-network)
        * [Fundamental neural network programming practice](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/NEURAL_NETWORK_PRACTICE) 
        
* Somewhat inexpensive laptops (bought using my personal finances) will be left on the premises of the institutions for their usage (for running "trained" ai models), while I will use my somewhat expensive desktop to "train" said Ai models where applicable.

# UPDATES - RE: MY FACE TO FACE ADVICE TO UWI MONA AI LECTURER TO INTRODUCE MODERN AI TO COURSEWORK
* 2016: In a face to face talk, I had advised UWI Mona Ai lecturer to introduced neural networks/modern artificial intelligence as an independent course to the Computer Science degree.

* 2016 later: I also started [Machine learning Jamaica Institute](http://mlj-institute.appspot.com/), as an independent institution for machine learning/modern artificial intelligence.

* June 2018: [I write about my advice to UWI Mona to introduce neural networks/modern artificial intelligence as an independent course to the Computer Science degree, as well as Machine Learning Jamaica Institute initiative/platform.](http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20180604/artificial-intelligence-and-economy-utilising-artificial-intelligence-could)

* September 2018: 

    * [UWI Mona introduced Data science/modern artificial intelligence to the 1st degree Computer Science coursework!!!!!!](https://www.mona.uwi.edu/compsci/sites/default/files/compsci/uploads/department_of_computing_list_of_undergraduate_courses_2018-2019.pdf)

    * [UWI Mona also introduces Master Of Science in Data Science in Computer Science!!!](https://www.mona.uwi.edu/compsci/new-data-science-programmes-0)

# UPDATES - Jamaican prime minister, Andrew Holness plans to build stem schools in response to growing Artificial Intelligence changes in society.

* June 2018: [I write about my advice to UWI Mona to introduce neural networks/modern artificial intelligence as an independent course to the Computer Science degree, as well as Machine Learning Jamaica Institute initiative/platform.](http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20180604/artificial-intelligence-and-economy-utilising-artificial-intelligence-could)

* November 2019: 

    * [UWI Mona introduced Data science/modern artificial intelligence to the 1st degree Computer Science coursework!!!!!!](https://www.mona.uwi.edu/compsci/sites/default/files/compsci/uploads/department_of_computing_list_of_undergraduate_courses_2018-2019.pdf)

    * [UWI Mona also introduces Master Of Science in Data Science in Computer Science!!!](https://www.mona.uwi.edu/compsci/new-data-science-programmes-0)
	
* However, I detect that STEM focussed schools while excellent, will not be sufficient to adequately prepare for the incoming automation, where even cognitive tasks like radiology stem careers, are already being automated away now:
    * Breaking news: [We can now diagnose pneumonia from chest X-rays better than radiologists.](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/projects/chexnet/)
    * This is a part of the reason why we opted to start [Machine Learning Jamaica Institute](http://mlj-institute.appspot.com/) in 2016.

# ROBOTIZE_JA 
Grand Project to "robotize" the island of Jamaica.




# GOAL
* In the aim of spreading Ai usage together with [Ai democratization](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/democratization-of-ai/), I travel across the country in order to apply Ai for free (Tier A) for several institution types. 

* This is of course limited only by the amount of time I have away from work, my reasonably good albeit growing knowledge/capacity in artificial intelligence, and lastly my personal finances to begin. 
    * Artificial Intelligence Projects of mine/knowledge base:
        * Machine Learning Jamaica Institute (as seen in the subsidiary section after this Goal section)
        * [Heart Irregularity Detection using convolutional residual neural networks](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/EJECTION-FRACTION-IRREGULARITY-DETECTION-MODEL)
        * [Smart Pothole Detector using fp16 convolutional neural networks](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Smart-Ai-Pothole-Detector------Powered-by-Tensorflow-TensorRT-on-Google-Colab-and-or-Jetson-Nano)
        * [Arrhythmia detection in browser using convolutional neural networks](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Browser-Ai-Arrhythmia-Detection)
        * [Jetson nano neural computer programming](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/live_ai_object-detection-on-tiny-jetson-neural-nano-computer)
        * [Live ITS 2019 Neural Network Programming Tutorial](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Live-ITS-2019-Artificial-Neural-Network-Tutorial-Code)
        * [Artificial Neural Networks for kids - Amazon book](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Neural-Networks-Kids-intuitive-ebook/dp/B077FX57ZZ) ..which is [free on ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321162382_Artificial_Neural_Nets_For_Kids)
        * [Supersymmetric Artificial Neural Network - This is Machine Learning Theory](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Supersymmetric-artificial-neural-network)
        * [Fundamental neural network programming practice](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/NEURAL_NETWORK_PRACTICE) 
        
* Somewhat inexpensive laptops (bought using my personal finances) will be left on the premises of the institutions for their usage (for running "trained" ai models), while I will use my somewhat expensive desktop to "train" said Ai models where applicable.

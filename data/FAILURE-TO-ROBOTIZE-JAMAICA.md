1. 800 million jobs shall be lost to automation up until the year 2035, [as forecasted by a study by Bank of America Merrill Lynch](https://www.inverse.com/article/60919-automation-jobs-millions-lost).

   * Truck driving is a quite popular job in USA, currently done by humans. 
     * [See rtsinc on why trucking  (by humans) is still americaâ€™s number one job](https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/why-trucking-still-america-s-number-one-job#:~:targetText=Truckers%20are%20Everywhere&targetText=There%20are%20more%20than%201.7,tied%20to%20the%20trucking%20industry).

4. [Waymo self driving taxis with no drivers had been live since 2018.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hqTnmn51Fg)
   * Taxi jobs have began to be lost.

5. Four (4) million jobs were automated away in America [according to a recent study](https://conexus.cberdata.org/files/MfgReality.pdf).

6. Thirty percent (30%) of shops in USA will be closed in a little while, due to things like amazon automation.

7. As one example, call center jobs are already being automated. [See sample call center job automation software.](https://www.digitalgenius.com/)
   * Call center jobs are quite popular in Jamaica.
   * Below are situations where Jamaicans are celebrating growing human-based call center jobs:

Conclusion
=========================
America has [trillion dollar corporations like Amazon](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/technology/amazon-stock-price-1-trillion-value.html#:~:targetText=Now%20Amazon%20has%20become%20the,below%20the%20%241%20trillion%20threshold.) that can be [taxed when it comes to automation.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/03/why-amazon-paid-no-federal-income-tax.html#:~:targetText=In%202018%2C%20Amazon%20paid%20%240,rebate%20from%20the%20federal%20government.).

Notably, the effects of automation are not constrained to America!!

Who shall countries like Jamaica tax when Jamaican jobs start to be consumed by global-like automation?

Since Jamaica has no Amazon-like place or large Artificial Intelligence aligned corporation, (and thereafter, little to no arguable means of delivering UBI-like programs of the scale that Yang's place of citizenship affords), some reasonble ways of combating these issues are to:

1. Introduce modern Artificial Intelligence in our university Computer Science degrees. Foreign countries have excellent modern Artificial Intelligence courses embedded in their Computer Science degrees.
   * [As I wrote in gleaner in 2018](http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20180604/artificial-intelligence-and-economy-utilising-artificial-intelligence-could), I advised UWI Artificial Intelligence lecturer to do this in 2016, and the lecturer is slowly introducing neural networks for eg since then.

2. Try to equip our medium sized businesses (that have hired programmers) with more Artificial Intelligence aligned components, including building Artificial Intelligence skills in human resources. 
   * I had already began running Ai seminars with live artificial neural network programming sessions, at [NCB where I work](https://www.jncb.com/).
   
3. Try to build independent institutions for Artificial Intelligence. (Abu Dhabi recently launched a [University of Artificial Intelligence](https://medium.com/@jordanmicahbennett/worlds-1st-university-like-artificial-intelligence-initiative-launched-somewhat-in-jamaica-d0deb56a4495)!)
   * In 2016 I had launched "Machine Learning Jamaica Institute", as I pointed out, [also in the aforementioned gleaner article](http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20180604/artificial-intelligence-and-economy-utilising-artificial-intelligence-could).
   
4. Launch initiatives such as [RobotizeJa](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/ROBOTIZE_JA/), to help democratize Artificial Intelligence usage.

The activities above, are reasonable ways to avoid or rather minimize abundant social-ills in the future, brought to bear by artificial intelligence usage, which is only speeding up, [in some cases exponentially](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2018/12/19/how-fast-is-artificial-intelligence-growing-look-at-the-key-bellwethers/#2a5dc1d7474a).

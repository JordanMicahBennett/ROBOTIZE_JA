Conclusion
=========================
America has [trillion dollar corporations like Amazon](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/technology/amazon-stock-price-1-trillion-value.html#:~:targetText=Now%20Amazon%20has%20become%20the,below%20the%20%241%20trillion%20threshold.) that can be [taxed when it comes to automation.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/03/why-amazon-paid-no-federal-income-tax.html#:~:targetText=In%202018%2C%20Amazon%20paid%20%240,rebate%20from%20the%20federal%20government.).

Notably, the effects of automation are not constrained to America!!

Who shall coutries like Jamaica tax when Jamaican jobs start to be consumed by global-like automation?

Since Jamaica has no Amazon-like place or large Artificial Intelligence aligned corporation, some reasonble ways of combating these issues are to:

1. Introduce modern Artificial Intelligence in our university Computer Science degrees. Foreign countries have excellent modern Artificial Intelligence courses embedded in their Computer Science degrees.
   * [As I wrote in gleaner in 2018](http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20180604/artificial-intelligence-and-economy-utilising-artificial-intelligence-could), I advised UWI Artificial Intelligence lecturer to do this in 2016, and the lecturer is slowly introducing neural networks for eg since then.

2. Try to equip our medium sized businesses (that have hired programmers) with more Artificial Intelligence aligned components, including building Artificial Intelligence skills in human resources.

3. Try to build independent institutions for Artificial Intelligence. (Abu Dhabi recently launched a [University of Artificial Intelligence](https://medium.com/@jordanmicahbennett/worlds-1st-university-like-artificial-intelligence-initiative-launched-somewhat-in-jamaica-d0deb56a4495)!)
   * In 2016 I had launched "Machine Learning Jamaica Institute", as I pointed out, [also in the aforementioned gleaner article](http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20180604/artificial-intelligence-and-economy-utilising-artificial-intelligence-could).
   
4. Launch initiatives such as [RobotizeJa](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/ROBOTIZE_JA/), to help democratize Artificial Intelligence usage.

The activities above, are reasonable ways to avoid or rather minimize abundant social-ills in the future, brought to bear by artificial intelligence usage, which is only speeding up, [in some cases exponentially](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2018/12/19/how-fast-is-artificial-intelligence-growing-look-at-the-key-bellwethers/#2a5dc1d7474a).

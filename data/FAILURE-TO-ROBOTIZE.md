1. Andrew Yang, a rising 2020 presidential candidate has already began to give 10 families Universal Basic Income-like pay of 1000 usd per month, no work required. (No work required. Plan is to give 1000 to every citizen 18 and older)

**Conclusion:**
America has corps like Amazon to tax when it comes to automation by large companies.

The effects of automation are not constrained to America!!

Who will Jamaica tax when Jamaican jobs start to dissapear?

We have no Amazon-like place or large Ai aligned corp, so some reasonble  ways are to:

1. Introduce modern Ai in our university computer science degrees. As I wrote in gleaner in 2018, I advised uwi Ai lecturer to do this in 2016, and the lecturer is slowly introducing neural networks for eg since then.

2.  Try to euip our medium sized businesses  (who have programmers) with more Artificial intelligence aligned components, including building Ai skills in human resources.

3. Build an independent institution for ai. In 2016 I had launched "Machine Learning Jamaica Institute." 

Things like these may be ways to avoid lots of social wrongs in the future. Let's act rather than wait and see!!
